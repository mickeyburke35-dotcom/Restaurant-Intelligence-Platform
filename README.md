# Restaurant Intelligence Platform

Restaurant Intelligence Platform is a multi-tenant B2B SaaS application for hospitality marketing agencies, restaurant consultants, and multi-location restaurant groups. It transforms approved public restaurant review data into AI-assisted sentiment analysis, theme extraction, insights, dashboards, and client-ready reports for teams managing multiple restaurant clients.

The application is planned as one React/Next.js app with API routes and background jobs in the same repository. UI routes live in `app/`, API routes live in `app/api/`, shared logic lives in `lib/`, reusable interface components live in `components/`, Prisma schema and database helpers live in `db/`, migrations live in `migrations/`, and scheduled review or competitor processing lives in `jobs/`.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- PostgreSQL

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

All required environment variables are documented in `.env.example`. Keep secrets, API keys, tokens, customer data, and production credentials out of source control.

For the Session 16 lead capture demo:

- `SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL used by the server route.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Server-only key used by `POST /api/demo/leads` to insert into `public.leads`.

Do not expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to client components or `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables.

---

## API Routes

### `POST /api/demo/leads`

Purpose: captures demo interest from `/demo/lead-capture`.

Input:

```json
{
  "email": "name@company.com"
}
```

Server behavior:

- Validates the request body with Zod.
- Inserts into `public.leads` with `email` and `source = "restaurant_demo"`.
- After a successful insert, starts a fire-and-forget server-side POST to the Session 16 Zapier webhook with `email`, `source`, and `created_at`.
- Logs Zapier webhook delivery failures without changing the lead capture response.
- Uses server-only Supabase environment variables.

Response:

- `201`: `{ "ok": true, "message": "Thanks. We will follow up to schedule your demo." }`
- `400`: invalid JSON or invalid email.
- `500`: server configuration or unexpected request failure.
- `502`: Supabase insert failure.

Auth: public demo endpoint. It does not read or modify tenant-scoped restaurant intelligence data.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Prisma

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma studio
```

## AI Principles

- AI assists users; it does not replace human decision-making.
- AI output must be generated only from collected and approved source data.
- The product must never fabricate reviews, statistics, competitor information, or business claims.
- AI insights must remain traceable to source reviews with supporting evidence.
- Insights should include model, timestamp, confidence, and source references when available.
- High-impact recommendations and client-facing narratives require human review before presentation as business advice.

---

## Development Workflow

Before coding:

- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `README.md` if present.
- Read `memory/MEMORY.md` and `memory/lessons.md`.
- Review the relevant project documentation and source files.
- Update `tasks/todo.md`.
- Write a short implementation plan.

During development:

- Work in small, focused commits.
- Preserve `agency_id` tenant isolation in API routes, Prisma queries, jobs, reports, exports, and AI prompts.
- Do not make architecture changes without approval.
- Do not make authentication or tenant logic changes without approval.
- Do not add dependencies without approval.
- Do not change data collection rules or AI insight behavior without approval.
